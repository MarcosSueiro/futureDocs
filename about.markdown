# tape transfers


## playback parameters
     
    1. Align head azimuth for each tape. 

    2. Use appropriate playback equalization (compensation EQ) and note it on the file’s CodingHistory field.     
    
    3. If known, apply Noise Reduction and note it on the file’s CodingHistory field.

    Match the deck's playback head to the tape's track configuration. 
    
    Use a different head configuration if you can obtain better results (e.g., playing back a degrading full-track tape with a two-track tape head).

    Generate one file for each reel. Edit each face of the reel together in program-sequence. Retain the lead-in and play-out of each face; do not cross-fade faces. 
    
    If the resulting file is larger than 4 GB, split the file into several

    Add markers to the file to delineate the start of each new face and name each marker consistently and descriptively, e.g., “Face 2”. See section Cue Markers below.
