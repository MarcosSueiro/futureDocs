# tape transfers


## playback parameters
[Audiotape digitisation workflow](https://musiikkiarkisto.fi/audio/)
     
1. Align head azimuth for each tape. 

2. Use appropriate playback equalization (compensation EQ) and note it on the file’s [CodingHistory](http://www.ebu.ch) field.     
    
3. If known, apply Noise Reduction and note it on the file’s CodingHistory field.

4. Match the deck's playback head to the tape's track configuration. 
    
    * Use a different head configuration if you can obtain better results (e.g., playing back a degrading full-track tape with a two-track tape head).

## file generation

1. Generate one file for each reel. Edit each face of the reel together in program-sequence. Retain the lead-in and play-out of each face; do not cross-fade faces. 
    
2. If the resulting file is larger than 4 GB, split the file into several at a logical point. Include overlaps if necessary.

## markers

1. Add markers to the file to delineate the start of each new face. Name each marker consistently and descriptively, e.g., “Face 2”. See section Cue Markers below.
